# Changelog

## 2025-12-17

- Initial workspace created
- Added bug report + root-cause analysis + diary entries; confirmed schema is transmitted end-to-end and the issue is frontend rendering (FormDialog ignores schema/field title/description)
- Removed accidental stray duplicate ticket folder so `docmgr doctor` passes (only unknown topic warnings remain)
